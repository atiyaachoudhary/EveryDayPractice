//Given a sorted array of distinct positive integers, print all triplets that forms an arithmetic progression with an integral common difference.
//An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant.
// For instance, sequence 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, â€¦ is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2.
//Input:  A[] = { 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15 }
//Output:
//5 8 11
//9 12 15
